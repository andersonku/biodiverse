To build needed Perl modules, copy the contents of the "c" directory to the
"c" directory in your Strawberry Perl installation.

The contents was generated by running on a Linux or Cygwin system:

cat >/etc/yum/repos.d/mingw.repo <<EOF
[mingw64]
name=mingw64
baseurl=http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/windows:/mingw:/win64/openSUSE_Factory/
enable=1
gpgcheck=0
[mingw32]
name=mingw32
baseurl=http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/windows:/mingw:/win32/openSUSE_Factory/
enable=1
gpgcheck=0
EOF
yum install --installroot=/chroot/mingw64 \
mingw64-cairo-devel \
mingw64-glib2-devel \
mingw64-hicolor-icon-theme \
mingw64-libcairo2 \
mingw64-libglade2 \
mingw64-libglade2-devel \
mingw64-libgnomecanvas \
mingw64-libgnomecanvas-devel \
mingw64-pango \
mingw64-pango-devel \
mingw64-pkg-config

and copying usr/x86_64-w64-mingw32/sys-root/mingw to c.

Because the C toolchain included with Strawberry Perl does not recognise
libexample.dll.a when passing the -lexample flag to gcc, it is necessary to
rename all files ending in .dll.a to just end in .a. With a bourne shell in
the lib directory, run:

for i in *.dll.a; do mv -v $i `basename $i .dll.a`.a; done

When building Gtk2 and Pango, the generated Makefile incorrectly contains:
C:\strawberry\c\lib\libCairo.a
in EXTRALIBS and LDLOADLIBS. It needs to be fixed to:
C:\strawberry\perl\site\lib\auto\Cairo\Cairo.a

In some of the modules, tests will fail, but it still seems to work fine with
Biodiverse.
